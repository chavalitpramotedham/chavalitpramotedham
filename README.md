👋 Hi, I’m Chavalit Pramotedham.

👀 I’m interested in leveraging new technologies to explore novel solutions for real-life problems.

💡 My current work philosophy is to "Fall in love with the PROBLEM, not the solution" (P.S. I highly recommend that book by Uri Levine, founder of Waze); In simpler terms:

      1 Discover and think deeply about problems I truly believe in;
      
      2 Think from First Principles, challenge my assumptions, to not be afraid/embarrassed to change my approach when new knowledge is made available;
      
      3 Move with conviction – not necessarily toward the solution I'm currently working on, but toward the broader value I'm trying to realize.
      
   I can't say I'm quite there yet, but that's my goal.

👨🏻‍💻 I’m currently a budding Product Manager at TikTok/ByteDance where I'm doing some interesting work with Location Products and Local Services.

🌱 These are some of the earlier projects I worked on as a Business and Computer Science student @ Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, but I hope to put out more substantive work in the future.

1. Motor Imagery Brain Computer Interface (MI-BCI) for Lower Limb Rehabilitation (https://github.com/chavalitpramotedham/LE_BCI_V1)
      - Novel MI-BCI system comprising ML models to decode EEG brain waves, and VR-based therapy app to empower, gamify and accelerate lower limb rehabilitation in post-stroke patients.

2. Community-Learning Social Media Application for Students - GeekHub (https://github.com/yiyoupteltd/GeekHub)
      - Social network application to facilitate community learning between students, leveraging APIs including Google Places, Wireless@SG and OpenWeather
      - Supports social functionalities such as location scouting, session invitations and sharing, and productivity functionalities such as personal task planning, task tracking and productivity reports.

3. Gamified Learning Application – QuizGuys (https://github.com/rchia013/SSAD)
      - Gamified Learning application to facilitate social, classroom-based activities (think Kahoot x FallGuys), teaching secondary-level topics with analytics-driven feedback. 

4. Machine Learning Stock Market Sentiment Predictor (https://github.com/rchia013/CZ4034_IR)
      - Stock market predictor (poorly-performing 🫥) based on real-time sentiment analysis of StockTwits (Financial Forum) activity, leveraging technologies such as Web-Scraping, NLP and Deep Learning (LSTM).
